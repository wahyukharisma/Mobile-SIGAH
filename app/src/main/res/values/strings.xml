4. The agreed prices include the current statutory VAT. Should the rate of VAT applicable to the contractual services increase or decrease after the conclusion of the contract, the prices shall be adjusted accordingly.\n
5. If the period between the conclusion of the contract and the fulfilment of the contract as defined by the contractual agreements exceeds four months and the general price charged for such services is increased by the hotel, this can increase the contractually agreed price as appropriate, but by 5 % at the most.\n
6. The hotel is entitled to increase the prices if municipal duties (culture tax, visitor’s tax, etc.) for the accommodation are increased. The price increase is limited to the costs of the abovementioned duties.\n
7. The hotel’s bills are payable immediately upon receipt of the bill without any deduction, unless other payment terms and conditions are expressly agreed. The hotel is entitled to render accumulated claims for payment at any time and to demand immediate payment. If payment is delayed, the hotel is entitled to claim interest for delay amounting to 10% above the base rate for companies and 5% above the base rate for consumers. The hotel is at liberty to prove that the damages are greater.\n
8. The subleasing and re-leasing of allocated rooms, other rooms, spaces or cabinets as well as inviting to interviews, sales or similar events require the prior written consent of the hotel, whereby § 540 para. 1 sentence 2 BGB [German Civil Code] shall be waived, provided that the customer is not a consumer.\n

4. On the agreed day of departure, check-out is at 12:00 at the latest. After that time the hotel can charge 50 % of the

overnight when the room is not occupied. The customer is at liberty to prove that the abovementioned claim does not
exist or does not exist to the amount claimed.\n
2. If a deadline for withdrawal from the contract free of charge was agreed between the hotel and the c ustomer, the
customer can withdraw from the contract until that point without initiating claims by the hotel for payment or
compensation for damages. The customer’s right to rescind expires if it does not exercise its right to rescind against
the hotel by the agreed deadline.\n
3. Services performed by third parties or special services (e.g. cakes, flowers, etc.) which become useless as a result of the
cancellation are to be paid by the customer in full.\n
VI.\n
Withdrawal of the customer from a contract for an event
(cancellation, rescission)\n
1. The customer is only entitled to rescind without charge if this has been agreed with the hotel in writing. Otherwise the hotel is

preparation in accordance with the following provisions, provided that it is not possible to book the rooms for another
customer.\n
2. The hotel is entitled to charge for the room or the conference package\n

- at a rate of 90 % for cancellation from 14 days before the beginning of the event.\n
3. If sales of food and drink are agreed, the hotel is entitled to charge the following additional costs in the case of cancellation:
If the customer cancels the booking for an event with agreed food and drink between the 8th and 4th week before the event, the
hotel is entitled to charge 35 % of the food sales lost and 20 % of the drinks sales, and is entitled to charge 80 % of the food and
drink sales from the 4th weeks until the beginning of the event. The sum for food and drinks is calculated according to the
number of participants agreed in the contract. If no sum for food and drinks was agreed in the contract, the cheapest three
course menu from the currently valid event offer shall be used as a basis for the all-inclusive price. The food bill will then be
calculated using the formula: menu price, banquet x number of people. Drinks sales are calculated as 50 % of the food bill.\n
4. The customer is at liberty to prove that the hotel is not at any loss as a result of the event not taking place or the loss for the
hotel is lower than the flat-rate compensation for damages claimed.\n

3. The hotel is entitled to rescind the contract with immediate effect if, for example,\n
- acts of God and other circumstances which the hotel is not responsible for make the fulfilment of the contract impossible;\n
- bedrooms and other rooms are intentionally booked using misleading or false statements about facts which are material to\n
the contract, e.g. who the customer is or the purpose of the stay;\n

catering department at the latest 7 days before the start of the event, so that it can be acknowledged by the hotel in the bill.
Deviations beyond this shall be based on the original number of participants registered less 5 %.\n
2. An increase in the number of participants of more than 5 % requires the written consent of the hotel. In the case of an increase,
the actual number of participants will be used as the basis for the bill.\n
3. If the number of participants is changed by more than 10 %, the hotel is entitled to exchange the agreed rooms, provided that
the size of the new rooms is appropriate for the latest number of participants notified and the rooms are comparably equipped.\n
4. If necessary the hotel is entitled to move the booked event to another room of the same value.\n
5. If the agreed start and finishing times of the event are changed without the prior written consent of the hotel, the hotel can
charge for the additional costs for the commitment according to § 315 BGB [German Civil Code], unless the hotel is
responsible for the change of times.\n
6. If the event carries on after midnight, the hotel is entitled to charge € 1.50 per guest and hour including VAT. The agreed
number of participants is the basis for the number of guests.\n
7. Displays are not allowed in the foyer and in the lobby. The prior written consent of the hotel is required to place advertising
material.\n
IX\n
Own food and drink\n
1. Only the hotel provides food and drink for events. Prior written agreement is required for exceptions to this. In these cases, a
sum to cover the overhead costs (“corkage”) shall be charged.\n
2. The customer is fully liable for the food and drinks brought along being fit for consumption and absolves the hotel in this respect
from any claims by third parties.\n
3. The hotel undertakes no liability for the shelf life of the food which is taken away to the hotel after an event at the hotel or
taken outside the hotel for private consumption.\n
X.\n
Technical equipment and connections\n
1. If the hotel procures technical and other equipment from third parties for the customer on its request, it deals in the name of,

proper return. It absolves the hotel from all claims by third parties for relinquishment of this equipment.\n
2. The use of the organiser’s own electrical equipment or that of third parties authorised by the organiser which uses the hotel ’s
electricity network requires the prior written consent of the hotel. Disruptions or damages to the hotel’s technical equipment

and charge at a flat rate the power costs which arise through the use of such equipment.\n
3. The customer is only entitled to use its own telephone, fax and data carrying equipment with the hotel’s consent. The hotel can

XI.\n
Music shows, artist exhibitions\n
1. If the rights of third parties are affected by events (copyrights, etc.), the customer is obligated to obtain appropriate permission at its own cost before the event is held and to pay fees which accrue (GEMA fees, etc.) directly. Nevertheless, should fees or claims for compensation for damages be made against the hotel for the reasons stated, the organiser absolves the hotel from such fees or claims for compensation for damages.\n
2. If liability to contribute to the Künstlersozialkasse [Artist’s Social Welfare Fund] is founded on the basis of artists cooperating in the event, the organiser is obligated to pay these contributions directly.\n
3. If the hotel engages artists for events for the customer, the hotel is entitled to pass on the fees for Artist Social Welfare to the customer.\n
XII.\n
Decoration material, exhibits for events\n
1. Decoration material, exhibits or other, also personal items belonging to the customer who is not himself a guest at the hotel, are kept in the event rooms or hotel at the customer’s own risk. The hotel undertakes no liability for loss, destruction or damage to such objects, except in the case of gross negligence or intent by the hotel. Damages resulting from death, injury to body or health are not included in the exclusion of liability. Moreover, all cases in which there is a duty of safekeeping on the basis of the facts in individual cases, the fulfilment of which is actually required before the contract can be properly carried out and whether the customer may have constant trust that it will be observed (material contractual duty) are excluded.\n
2. Decoration material brought along must comply with the fire protection regulations. The hotel is entitled to demand an official certificate for this. If the customer does not comply with this request from the hotel, the hotel is entitled to remove and store the decoration material at the cost of the customer. Because of the possible damages, it is only permissible to install and fit items on walls and ceilings with the prior written consent of the hotel.\n
3. All exhibition or other objects brought by the customer or participants of the event are to be removed by the customer immediately after the event finishes. If the customer does not comply with its duty to remove immediately, the hotel is entitled to remove and store the objects at the cost of the customer. If objects remain in the event room, the hotel can charge the agreed price for the room for the duration in which they stay. The customer may still prove that the damages due are lower and the hotel may still prove that they are higher.\n
4. The customer is to ensure that any waste is properly disposed of according to the relevant statutory provisions.\n
5. If the customer commissions the hotel with the disposal of packaging material, the hotel is entitled to charge the customer with the costs arising from this.\n
XIII.\n
Customer’s liability\n
The organiser is liable for all damages to the hotel building and its equipment, which was caused by the organiser, event participants, event visitors, the organiser’s staff or other third parties working in its domain. The hotel can demand appropriate securities (e.g. insurance, deposits, guarantees etc.) from the organiser to protect against exposure to liability.\n
XIV.\n
Defects, customer’s obligation to cooperate\n
Should defects in the deliveries or services by the hotel arise or services are disrupted, the customer is to inform the hotel about this immediately after it is identified so that the hotel is able to remedy the fault as quickly as possible or provide the delivery or service as understood under the contract. If this is not possible because of the nature of the defect/disruption or other compelling reasons, notification of defects must in each case be made to the hotel on return of the rooms at the latest. The customer is obligated to keep damages arising to it as low as possible.\n
- 5 -\n
XV.\n
Hotel’s liability\n
1. The hotel is liable to carry out its contractual duties with the diligence of a prudent businessperson. Claims by the customer for compensation for damages are excluded. Excluded from this are damages arising from death, injury to body or health. Damages due to the intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by the hotel are also not included in the exclusion of liability. The exclusion of liability also does not include damages arising from the breach of material contractual duties. Material contractual duties are those which are actually required to be fulfilled before the contract can be properly carried out and the customer may place constant trust in their fulfilment. Further, the strict liability imposed by the Produkthaftungsgesetz [law on product liability] remains unaffected as well as the liability arising from a guarantee potentially taken by the hotel. A breach of duty by the hotel has the same consequences for legal representatives or assistants.\n
2. The hotel is liable to the customer for things brought in according to the statutory provisions (§§ 701 et. seq. BGB [German Civil Code]).\n
3. If the customer is provided with a place to put the things in the hotel garage or in a hotel parking place, no contract for safekeeping is created.\n
4. Claims by the customer against the hotel prescribe after a year from knowledge of the facts which found this claim. Claims for compensation for damages prescribe after 5 years whether or not knowledge of them is received. This shortening of the statutory periods of prescription does not apply in the case of culpable death, injury to body or in the case of liability under the product liability law.\n
XVI.\n
Final provisions\n
1. Alterations and additions to the contract for accommodation and events are required to be in writing to be effective. Waiving the requirement of writing is also required to be in writing.\n
2. The place of fulfilment and payment is the registered office of the hotel.\n
3. The place where the hotel has its registered office is the exclusive jurisdiction for commercial issues. Provided that a party to the contract has fulfilled the requirements of § 38 para. 2 ZPO [Code of Civil Procedure] and has no general jurisdiction at in the country, the jurisdiction of the hotel’s registered office applies.\n
4. The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies exclusively. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and provisions on conflict of laws does not apply.\n
5. Should individual provisions of the accommodation or event contract or individual provisions of these general terms and conditions for hotel accommodation and for holding events be or become ineffective, the effectiveness of the remaining provisions will remain unaffected by this. Moreover, the statutory provisions apply.\n</string>
